# Further Game Details

On connection player must enter name, and is then assigned a colour based on their assigned connection ID.

Players can find new weapons and power ups (currently 'bike' and 'mushroom' only) by searching in grass and water.

Navigating through grass and water reduces the players movement speed. 

Bikes 2x the players speed.

Mushrooms 2x the players size - providing temporary immunity to death and the ability to trample other players via contact.

Game statistics are shown in the menu/leaderboard (Z).

Host is considered to be first person connected to the server.

# Controls

Movement: Arrow Keys

Shoot: Spacebar

Strafe: S

Menu/Leaderboard: Z

Show Grid: X

Change Map (Host only): C

# Requirements
- python3.7

- pygame

# How to run

Change HOST and PORT in config.py to reflect your setup.

Ideally place server.py, config.py and leaderboard.py on a server. Create a new database from the leaderboard file. Multiple instances can then be launched from anywhere with many players playing simultaneously.

Another option is to download and use Hamachi to simulate your LAN. 

Only the host player must run server.py. Other players need only run main.py.
